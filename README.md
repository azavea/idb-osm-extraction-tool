### Description and Context
---

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/32028b66-fa0e-409e-a97a-58cf4d3359dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/idb-osm-extraction-tool/deploys)

Friendly front-end for querying OSM features around Guyana from the
[Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) and
extracting as a Shapefile.

#### Adding NPM Packages

To add a new NPM package to the project:

- Manually add the package to the project's `package.json` file, ensuring that you
pin it to a specific version.
- Run `./scripts/update` in the VM.
- Commit the changes to the following files to git:
    - `package.json`
    - `yarn.lock`
- We usually pin packages to a specific version to minimize build errors.

#### Creating a Release with Git Flow

This project uses git flow for releases. You can [find the latest version of
`git-flow` to install here](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh).

Once it's installed, you'll need to enable `git flow` in your local version of
the repo by typing:

```sh
git flow init
```

Use the default values provided; `master` for the current release, `develop` for
the next release. Since the release process entails pulling changes from
`develop` into a release, then merging that into `master`, you should ensure
that `develop` builds successfully on Travis before commencing a release.

After you've enabled `git flow`, you can use the following commands to make a
release, replacing "1.2.3" with the version you're releasing and updating the
`CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` to match that version.

```sh
git flow release start 1.2.3
vim CHANGELOG.md
vim src/package.json
git add CHANGELOG.md src/package.json
git commit -m "1.2.3"
git flow release publish 1.2.3
git flow release finish 1.2.3
```

After you've completed the `git flow` steps, you'll need to push the changes
from your local `master` and `develop` branches back to the main repository and
push the release tags to finalize the release:

```sh
git push origin master:master
git push origin develop:develop
git push --tags
```

Once you've pushed the tags, the new release will appear in the project's
["Releases" tab in GitHub](https://github.com/azavea/idb-osm-extraction-tool/releases).
There you can edit the tagged release to add release notes.

### Feature configuration
OSM tags are grouped into high level features in [the config file](src/js/src/featureConfig.js).
The configuration can take all values of a tag, only certain keys of a
tag, and multiple tags. A comprehensive example of a feature configuration is:

```javascript
{
        label: 'Shop/Business',
        entities: [
            { tag: 'shop' },
            { tag: 'craft' },
            { tag: 'office' },
            {
                tag: 'building',
                values: ['office'],
            },
            {
                tag: 'amenity',
                values: ['restaurant', 'cafe', 'internet_cafe', 'bar', 'biergarten', 'fast_food', 'marketplace', 'fuel'],
            },
        ],
    },
```

The OSM tags will be converted to an [Overpass API query](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide) and fetched from that service.
